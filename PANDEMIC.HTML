<font color= "black">  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) <b> is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. <b>
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.<b> The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.<b> These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.<b>
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.<b>
